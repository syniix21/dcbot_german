# dcbot_german

Hello, I would like to introduce the bot in this short text. In addition, I am not really good at English. It is my first bot. I coded it in Python. Unfortunately, it is in German and yes I hate myself for doing that  So we come to the bot. So it should be a fun bot. With commands from $ coin_flip to $ move and $ spam to $ rand_zit but also some useful commands like $ yn or $ say or $ math, this bot also has its own bot  Jokes system ($ Joke)
